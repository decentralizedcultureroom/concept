With spanning over 5 rooms on the 3rd floor of the Factory, the Culture Room is set out to facilitate a variety of creative outlets and sources of inspiration - all which are vital parts of making Berlin into what it is.

 

The music room - A room for the participants to come and listen to and interact with musicians  from Berlin. This room will have a schedule of events which will be announced before the happening of EthBerlin.

 

The nature room - A room containing visual, sound and sensory installations which will portray the wild nature found in the parks of Berlin. This installation will be running for the whole three days and allow for the participants to take a break from the digital and experience the nature of Berlin.

 

The DIY room - The room will allow for the participants to come an create something of their own, with their hands. We envision this to be a room that can allow for them to come and create their own instrument. The DIY culture is very prominent in Berlin and is also reflecting the nature of the event – i.e. building from a clean slate.

 

The art room - This room will house a sounds or visual installation by one of the many contemporary artists residing in Berlin. The team would like to work with Euan Williams, a contemporary artist based in Berlin, whose work is inspired by process. Williams work has been exhibited at Hamburger Bahnhof - Museum für Gegenwart, Werkstatt der Kulturen, Martin-Gropius-Bau and Neue Nationalgalerie.


The Freedom room - this room will be a venue for freedom of speech and expression without restriction - mirroring the open-source and permissionless nature of the ecosystem we are working within. When a participant enters the room it will be empty, and we kindly ask them to leave it as they found it.
