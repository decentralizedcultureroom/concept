DRAFT CONCEPT
=============

What is it about this city that nurtures alternative ecosystems to grow? What is this freedom?

A city with constant growing pains, in flux, impermanent, Berlin is about creation.

Come to the Decentralized Culture Room at ETHBerlin and leave with a different perspective.
